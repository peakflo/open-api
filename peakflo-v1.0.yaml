        Update Bill API offers two primary functionalities: updating bill information and updating the status of a bill to "paid". 

        to mark a bill as paid, users must supply the bill ID, along with the status set to "paid", vendor ID, and payment amount. 

        Note that when updating a bill to "paid", the parameters status, vendorId, and paymentAmount are mandatory, while other parameters are optional for updating additional bill details.
